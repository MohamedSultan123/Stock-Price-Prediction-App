# Netflix Stock-Price-Prediction-App with Regression Models
This project is a Stock Price Prediction Application built with Python, using multiple regression models and a graphical user interface (GUI). The app allows users to predict the "Close" price of a stock based on historical data and select from different regression techniques for better model comparison.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation metrics
Tkinter for building the interactive GUI

📊 Models Implemented:
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
SGD Regressor

🚀 Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling using StandardScaler.
Model Training & Evaluation: Comparing models using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R².
Interactive GUI: Allowing users to input feature values and choose a model for real-time predictions.
Flexible Model Selection: Easily switch between different regression models and see their performance.


🌟 Results & Insights:
Visualized correlations and feature importance.
Evaluated model performance to identify the most accurate predictor.
Tuned hyperparameters for better generalization and performance
